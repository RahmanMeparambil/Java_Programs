// Grades are computed using a weighted average.
// Suppose that the written test counts 70%,  lab exams 20% and assignments 10%.
// If Arun has a score of
// Written test = 81
// Lab exams = 68
// Assignments = 92
// Arunâ€™s overall grade = (81x70)/100 + (68x20)/100 + (92x10)/100 = 79.5
// Write a program to find the grade of a student during his academic year. 
// Program should accept the scores for written test, lab exams and assignments
// Output the grade of a student (using weighted average)
